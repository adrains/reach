"""
Script to parse the ESO run summary and produce a set of complete bright/faint
concatenations, which are then copied to a new directory structure for only
**complete** sequences for simplicity during the following reduction steps.
Sequences are ideally matched automatically, but peculiarities in the way
several sequences were observed necessitate manual intervention (e.g. when
the science and calibrators are out of order, or marked with grades that don't
correspond to their quality per what the logs say.

Each observation has a night log text file describing the details of the
observation, which is parsed to build a summary of all logs. Associated with
this is the raw data, and both are copied to the new directory structure when
sequence matching is complete.

TODO: also extract any log notes, and save the sequence dictionaries assembled
here as pickles for easy reference later during data reduction and calibration.
