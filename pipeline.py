Script to run complete diameter computation pipeline. The broad steps are 
outlined below.

A) Target and calibrator background:
    1) Collate target information from literature
        i)   SpT, + spectroscopic T_eff, log(g), [Fe/H]
        ii)  Magnitudes: V (Tycho-2), K (2MASS), reddening (Green et al. 2015)
        iii) F_bol from spectrophotometrically calibrated spectra + atmospheres 
        iv)  Previous interferometric measurements
    2) Collate calibrator information from literature
        i)  SpT
        ii) Magnitudes: V (Tycho-2), K (2MASS), reddening (Green et al. 2015)
    
B) Observation reduction, organisation
    1) Download and reduce all observations
    2) Organise reduced obervations
    3) Using generate_obs_summary.py, determine which observations are complete
       and calibrate only the complete/best quality bright/faint sequences. 
       This is done by creating/editing pndrsScript.i with the functions:
        i)   oiFitsFlagOiData - ignoring observsations within pndrs
        ii)  oiFitsSplitNight - splitting the "night" between different 
             sequences within pndrs
       At the conclusion of this calibration, there should be a single oiFits
       file for each science target containing the (among other things) the 
       squared visibilities and closure phases.

C) Calculation of angular diameters
    1) Determine limb darkening coefficients by interpolating grids derived
       from model atmospheres for the previously obtained spectroscopic values
    2) Determine linear limb-darkened diameters as per Hanbury Brown et al 1974
    3) Perform Monte Carlo model-fitting parameter uncertainty estimation
    4) Compare with photometric predictions of LDD
